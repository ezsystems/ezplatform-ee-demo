## What is eZ Platform Enterprise Edition?
*eZ Platform Enterprise Edition* is commercial CMS (Content Management System) software developed by eZ Systems.

*eZ Platform Enterprise Edition* derives from *eZ Platform*. It is composed of a set of bundles. eZ Platform Enterprise Edition, like eZ Platform, is built on top of the Symfony framework (Full Stack). It has been in development since 2014.

## Issue tracker
Submitting bugs, improvements and stories is possible on https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZEE.
If you discover a security issue, please see how to responsibly report such issues on https://doc.ez.no/Security.

## Backwards compatibility
eZ Platform aims to be **100% content compatible** with eZ Publish 5.x, 4.x and 3.x *(introduced in 2002)*, meaning that content in those versions of the CMS can be upgraded using
[online documentation](http://doc.ez.no/eZ-Publish/Upgrading) to eZ Platform.

Unlike eZ Publish Platform 5.x, eZ Platform does not ship with eZ Publish Legacy (4.x). But this is available by optional installing [LegacyBridge](https://github.com/ezsystems/LegacyBridge/releases/) to allow eZ Platform and eZ Publish Legacy to run together, this is only recommended for migration use cases and not for new installations.
